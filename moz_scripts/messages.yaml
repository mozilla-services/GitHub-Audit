            Hello! This is your neighborhood secops team looking out for you!


            The production branch on this repository is no longer
            protected against force pushes. This setting is recommended
            as part of [Mozilla's Guidelines][guidelines_url] for a
            Sensitive Repository.


            Branch protection had been configured previous for this
            repository, so you may want to check how the setting became
            unchecked.


            **Anyone with admin permissions for this repository can correct the
            setting using [this URL][protect_url].**
